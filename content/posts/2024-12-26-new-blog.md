Yep, as the title says, this is my new blog page! I will still keep the [other one](https://www.pedrohosilva.wordpress.com) on WordPress which I have maintained [since 2013](https://pedrohosilva.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/problema-adb-nao-reconhece-meu-dispositivo-android/) writing primarily in Portuguese. 

Here, I'll focus on writing in English about Java, AI, coding, testing, code smells, and more, but first, Let me introduce myself to those who don't know me: 

I'm Pedro Hos a passionate software developer with over 10 years of experience writing primarily in Java. Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), working on the Application Runtimes Sustaining team with Wildfly, Quarkus, Keycloak, and other products. I lead the [JUG Vale community](https://jug-vale.github.io) and advocate for open data and open-source initiatives since 2012. I enjoy mountain biking, writing, cooking, and hiking in my free time.

If you are asking why the blog logo is a pig with green eyes, I will tell you why. I am a supporter of [Palmeiras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SE_Palmeiras) soccer team, and the Palmeiras's team mascot is a pig, the primary color is green!  

Palmeiras is the biggest champion of national tournaments, having lifted the trophy 11 times since 1960.

## Roq, using Quarkus for static pages

I have used [Roq](https://pages.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-roq/) which is based on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) to bring this blog alive:

> A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best-of-breed Java libraries and standards.

We will talk more about Quarkus, Wildfly, Keycloak, and more here in future posts.

## 2025 Plans

My plans for 2025 are to be more active in the community, that's by coding open-source projects, blogging, attending and talking at conferences, etc. 

So, I would like to keep this blog active, talking about things I like, not only in tech, but also about other things I enjoy, like mountain biking, movies, philosophy, history, science, and whatever else I want.

For my personal goals, one of the most important this year is to complete the ["Faith's Way"](http://eyecycled.com/en_GB/2017/09/15/faiths-way-caminho-da-fe/) by bicycle. This is a pilgrimage route, considered to be the Brazilian equivalent of the way of St. James or [Camino de Santiago](http://eyecycled.com/index-pages/camino-de-santiago/). The route between Aguas da Prata in the Federal State of SÃ£o Paulo and the Basilica, in Aparecida do Norte is almost 318 Km. 

I plan to complete the path in 5 days with my father to celebrate his 60 years. I know that I need to prepare my mind and body to complete this challenge, and I hope to do that! =D

That's it for now! I wish the best for all and Happy New Year!!!
